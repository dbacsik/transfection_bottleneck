# transfection_bottleneck

I would like to learn what the best practices for generating barcoded influenza via reverse genetics are.

My goal is to generate maximum diversity in the viral barcodes, when sampling a small number of virions from the virus library. For this analysis, I have chosen to target a sample of 1000 virions.

I used data generated by myself and Allie Greaney for this analysis. In my experiment ("db_large"), I did the virus rescue in 12x96 well plates. Allie performed two experiments ("pilot" and "monster") the pilot experiment used a variety of cell culture methods and compared WSN and pdm internals. The monster experiment used the Kawaoka single plasmid system for all segments except NA.
